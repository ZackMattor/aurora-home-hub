# shelfio
This is the GUI for the IOT bookshelf "Shelfio". Each shelf has an LED strip of 20 RGB LEDs illuminating it. This is the application used to control the lighting.

In the following video you can see one of the animations where you can hover/tap over the virtual shelf and do a cool color degregation animation. You can also see the frame data getting sent.
